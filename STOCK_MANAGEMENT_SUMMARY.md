### Database Queries Enhanced

SELECT b.*, COALESCE(loan_stats.units_loaned, 0) as units_loaned
FROM books b
LEFT JOIN (
    SELECT id_book, COUNT(*) as units_loaned
    FROM loans
    WHERE returned = 0 AND state = 1
    GROUP BY id_book
) loan_stats ON b.id_book = loan_stats.id_book
```

### Transaction-based Stock Management

```javascript
// Example: Loan creation with stock management
dbConn.beginTransaction((err) => {
  // 1. Validate stock
  // 2. Create loan record
  // 3. Reduce stock
  // 4. Commit or rollback
});
```

### Stock Badge Logic

```javascript
let stockBadgeClass = "";
if (stock > 10) stockBadgeClass = "badge-success";
else if (stock >= 6) stockBadgeClass = "badge-warning";
else if (stock >= 1) stockBadgeClass = "badge-danger";
else stockBadgeClass = "badge-dark";
```
